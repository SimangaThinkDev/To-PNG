JPEG to PNG Converter with Background Removal

Overview

This repository contains a simple yet powerful script that converts JPEG images to PNG format, effectively removing the background of a picture. This process leverages the transparency capabilities of PNG files, making it ideal for logos, icons, and graphics that require a clear background.

Features

- Converts JPEG images to PNG format
- Automatically removes the background of the image
- Preserves transparency for logos, icons, and graphics

How it Works

The script utilizes image processing libraries to analyze the JPEG image and identify the background. It then converts the image to PNG format, replacing the background with transparency.

Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pillow library (install using pip install pillow)
- Optional: additional libraries for advanced image processing (listed in requirements.txt)

Usage

1. Clone this repository: `git clone (link unavailable)
2. Install required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt
